(a) The probability that a customer purchases none of these items is given by 1 - P(purchasing at least one item), where P(purchasing at least one item) is the sum of the probabilities of purchasing each individual item and all combinations of items.

P(purchasing at least one item) = P(purchasing a suit) + P(purchasing a shirt) + P(purchasing a tie) - P(purchasing both a suit and a shirt) - P(purchasing both a suit and a tie) - P(purchasing both a shirt and a tie) + P(purchasing all three items)

= .22 + .30 + .28 - .11 - .14 - .10 + .06

= .71

Therefore, P(purchasing none of these items) = 1 - .71 = .29

(b) The probability that a customer purchases exactly 1 item is the sum of the probabilities of purchasing each individual item and not purchasing the other two items.

P(purchasing exactly 1 item) = P(purchasing a suit) + P(purchasing a shirt) + P(purchasing a tie) - 2 * P(purchasing both a suit and a shirt) - 2 * P(purchasing both a suit and a tie) - 2 * P(purchasing both a shirt and a tie) + 3 * P(purchasing all three items)

= .22 + .30 + .28 - 2 * .11 - 2 * .14 - 2 * .10 + 3 * .06

= .57











To find the probability that the minimum of the two midtown temperatures is 70°F, we need to calculate the probability that either both temperatures are 70°F or one of the temperatures is 70°F and the other is less than 70°F.

Let's call the event that both temperatures are 70°F as event D. We have:

P(D) = P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = .3 * .4 = .12

Next, let's call the event that one temperature is 70°F and the other is less than 70°F as event E. We have:

P(E) = P(A and not B) + P(not A and B) = P(A) * (1 - P(B)) + (1 - P(A)) * P(B) = .3 * (1 - .4) + (1 - .3) * .4 = .18

Finally, the probability that the minimum of the two midtown temperatures is 70°F is given by the sum of the probabilities of events D and E:

P(minimum is 70°F) = P(D) + P(E) = .12 + .18 = .30

So, the probability that the minimum of the two midtown temperatures is 70°F is 0.30.
